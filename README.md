# Overview

In this program I practiced Java. I am trying to become fluent in this programming language.

This software is a personal library that anyone can use. It includes a csv file in which one can store books. It also includes a LibraryApp.java file that includes the program. Thanks to this file one can view the books stored in the csv file, borrow a book, search a book and return a book. 

This can help individuals to keep track of the books in their collection and which ones have been borrowed by friends.

# Development Environment

For this program I utilized the website called w3schools that contains a lot of information about the basics of Java and many exampoles. I also utilized ChatGPT if I ever got stuck with any questions about the syntax that i could not find in w3Schools. Also, Stack overflow helped with the set up of the enviroment in my macbook.

For this program I utilized Java.
